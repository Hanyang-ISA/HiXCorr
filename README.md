# HiXCorr
We compared Tide-Hi and Comet-Hi, where our HiXCorr implementation is implanted, with the previous implementations of Tide-C, Tide-x86 and Comet-Sparse. (Since the original Comet-Sparse modifies the mass resolution into 0.01 if the input mass resolution is higher than 0.01 such as 0.005, we disabled the modification to run it with higher resolutions than 0.01.) These comparison data were achieved on a machine with an Intel Core i7-3770K CPU (3.50 GHz) and 32GB RAM under the CentOS 6.6 operating system. The MS/MS Data were downloaded from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (NCI/NIH) data portal.

Tide-Hi and Comet-Hi binaries can be downloaded and executed as described below. They require Linux OS (64-bit) or Windows (64-bit) on x86 CPU and at least 2 GB memory. If you can access both Linux and Windows machines, the binaries for Linux are recommended.
