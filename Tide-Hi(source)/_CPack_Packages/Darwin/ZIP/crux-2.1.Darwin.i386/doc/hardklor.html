<p>
<B>Input:</B>

<UL>

<LI>
&lt;spectra&gt; &ndash; The name of a file from which to parse
high-resolution spectra.  The file may be in MS1 (.ms1),
binary MS1 (.bms1), compressed MS1 (.cms1), or mzXML (.mzXML) format.
</li>

</UL>

<B>Output:</B>

<p>
The program writes files to the folder <code>crux-output</code> by
default.  The name of the output folder can be set by the user using
the <code>--output-dir</code> option.  The following files will be
created:</p>
<ul>

<li>
<b>hardklor.params.txt</b>: a file containing the name and value of all
parameters/options for the current operation.  Not all parameters in
the file may have been used in the operation.  The resulting file can
be used with the <code>--parameter-file</code> option for other crux
programs.
</li>

<li>
<b>hardklor.mono.txt</b>: a tab-delimited text file containing one
line for each isotope distribution.  The columns appear in the
following order:</li>

<ol>
<li>
<b>scan</b>: The scan number assigned to this spectrum in the input
file.</li>
<li>
<b>retention time</b>: The time (in seconds) at which the spectrum
was collected.</li>
<li>
<b>mass</b>: The uncharged monoisotopic mass of the protein or
peptide.</li>
<li>
<b>charge</b>: The inferred charge state of the protein or peptide.</li>
<li>
<b>intensity</b>: The intensity of the base isotope peak of the model
used to predict the protein or peptide.</li>
<li>
<b>m/z</b>: The m/z of the base peak.</li>
<li>
<b>s/n</b>: The signal-to-noise threshold, i.e., the relative
abundance a peak must exceed in the spectrum window to be considered
in the scoring algorithm.  Note that this is a local noise threshold
for the area of the spectrum that the peptide was identified in</li>
<li>
<b>modifications</b>: Deviations to the averagine model.  Only
modifications specified by the user are considered.  If no
modifications are found in a particular PPID, then the column is
marked with an underscore.</li>
<li>
<b>dotp</b>: The dot product score applies to all predictions in a
given spectrum window. Thus, if two protein or peptide predictions
share the same spectrum window, then they have a single dot product
score that is the score of their combined peaks. </li>
</ol>

<li>
<b>hardklor.log.txt</b>: a log file containing a copy of all messages
that were printed to stderr.

</ul>

<B>Options:</B>
<UL>

<li>
<code>--hardklor-algorithm &lt;name&gt;</code> &ndash; Choose the algorithm for
analyzing combinations of multiple peptide or protein isotope
distributions. There are five algorithms to choose from:
<ul>
<li>
<code>basic</code> &ndash; Computes all combinatorial possibilities
and returns the combination with the highest score.</li>
<li>
<code>fewest-peptides</code> &ndash; Computes increasing depths of
combinations until the score threshold is exceeded. The smallest
combination exceeding the threshold is returned, preventing
over-fitting of the data.</li>
<li>
<code>fast-fewest-peptides</code> &ndash; Same as
the <code>fewest-peptides</code> algorithm, but trades memory usage
for speed. Use this method if there is sufficient memory on the
system.</li>
<li>
<code>fewest-peptides-choice</code> &ndash; Same as
the <code>fewest-peptides</code> algorithm, but adds a heuristic to
evaluate if further combinatorial analysis would produce a better
score. This method can dramatically improve speed, but may not be as
accurate.</li>
<li>
<code>fast-fewest-peptides-choice</code> &ndash; Same as the
<code>fewest-peptides-choice</code> algorithm, but trades memory usage
for speed. Use this method if there is sufficient memory on the
system.</li>
</ul>
The default setting is fast-fewest-peptides.</li>

<li>
<code>--cdm B|F|P|Q|S</code> &ndash; Choose the charge state
determination method. There are five methods to choose from:
<ul>
<li>
<code>B</code> &ndash; Basic method, assume all charge states are
possible.</li>
<li>
<code>F</code> &ndash; Fast Fourier transform.</li>
<li>
<code>P</code> &ndash; Patterson algorithm.</li>
<li>
<code>Q</code> &ndash; QuickCharge method, uses inverse peak
distances.</li>
<li>
<code>S</code> &ndash; Senko method, or combined Fast Fourier
Transform and Patterson algorithm.</li>
</ul>
The default setting is Q.</li>

<li>
<code>--min-charge &lt;int&gt;</code> &ndash; Set the minimum charge
state to look for when analyzing a spectrum. The default value is
1.</li>

<li>
<code>--max-charge &lt;int&gt;</code> &ndash; Set the maximum charge
state to look for when analyzing a spectrum. The default value is
5.</li>

<li>
<code>--corr &lt;float&gt;</code> &ndash; Set the correlation
threshold to accept a predicted isotope distribution. Valid values are
any decimal value between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive. The default value is
0.85.</li>

<li>
<code>--depth &lt;int&gt;</code> &ndash; Set the depth of
combinatorial analysis. This is the maximum number of protein or
peptide distributions that can be combined to estimate the observed
data at any given spectrum segment. The default value is 3.</li>

<li>
<code>--distribution-area &lt;T|F&gt;</code> &ndash; Report peptide
intensities as the distribution area. Default false.</li>

<li>
<code>--averagine-mod &lt;string&gt;</code> &ndash; Include alternative
averagine models in the analysis that incorporate additional atoms or
isotopic enrichments. Modifications are represented as text
strings. Inclusion of additional atoms in the model is done using by
entering an atomic formula such as "PO2" or "Cl". Inclusion of
isotopic enrichment to the model is done by specifying the percent
enrichment (as a decimal) followed by the atom being enriched and an
index of the isotope. For example, 0.75H1 specifies 75% enrichment of
the first heavy isotope of hydrogen. In other words, 75% deuterium
enrichment. Two or more modifications can be combined into the same
model and separated by colons: "B2:0.5B1". Multiple averagine models
are supported in a single analysis by separating the models with a 
semicolon: "B2:0.5B1;C2:0.7C1".</li>

<li>
<code>--mzxml-filter ms1|ms2|ms3|none</code> &ndash; Set a filter for
mzXML files. If you want to analyze only the MS2 scans in your mzXML
file, specify <code>--mzxml-filter MS2</code>.  Default = none.</li>

<li>
<code>--no-base T|F</code> &ndash; Specify "no base" averagine. Only
modified averagine models will be used in the analysis. Default =
F.</li>

<li>
<code>--max-p &lt;int&gt;</code> &ndash; Set the maximum number of
peptides or proteins that are estimated from the peaks found in a
spectrum segment. The default value is 10.</li>

<li>
<code>--resolution &lt;double&gt;</code> &ndash;
Set the resolution of the observed spectra at m/z 400. Resolution
is a unitless quantity defined as the mass of the peak divided by the
associated width at half maximum height (FWHM).  Used in
conjunction with <code>--instrument</code>. The default is 100000.</li>

<li>
<code>--instrument fticr|orbi|tof|qit</code> &ndash;
Type of instrument on which the data was collected.  Used in
conjuction with <code>--resolution</code>.  The default is fticr.</li>

<li>
<code>--centroided T|F</code> &ndash; Are the spectra centroided?  
Default = F.</li>

<li>
<code>--scan-number &lt;number range&gt;</code> &ndash; A single scan
number or a range of numbers to be analyzed. Range should be specified
as 'first-last' which will include scans 'first' and 'last'.  Default
= search all spectra.</li>

<li>
<code>--sensitivity 0|1|2|3</code> &ndash; Set the sensitivity
level. There are four levels, 0 (low), 1 (moderate), 2 (high), and 3
(max). Increasing the sensitivity will increase computation time, but
will also yield more isotope distributions. The default value is 2.</li>

<li>
<code>--signal-to-noise &lt;float&gt;</code> &ndash; Set the
signal-to-noise threshold. Any integer or decimal value greater than
or equal to 0.0 is valid. The default value is 1.0.</li>

<li>
<code>--sn-window &lt;float&gt;</code> &ndash; Set the signal-to-noise
window length (in m/z). Because noise may be non-uniform across a
spectra, this value adjusts the segment size considered when
calculating a signal-over-noise ratio. The default value is 250.0.</li>

<li>
<code>--static-sn &lt;T|F&gt;</code> &ndash; If true, Hardklor will
calculate the local noise levels across the spectrum
using <code>--sn-window</code>, then select a floor of this set of
noise levels to apply to the whole spectrum.  Default is true.</li>

<li>
<code>--mz-window &lt;double&gt;-&lt;double&gt;</code> &ndash; Restrict
analysis to only a small window in each segment (in m/z). The user
must specify the starting and ending m/z values between which the
analysis will be performed. By default the whole spectrum is
analyzed.</li>

<li>
<code>--max-width &lt;float&gt;</code> &ndash; Set the maximum width
of any set of peaks in a spectrum when computing the results (in
m/z). Thus, if the value was 5.0, then sets of peaks greater than 5
m/z are divided into smaller sets prior to analysis. The default value
is 4.0.</li>

<h3>Output</h3>

<li>
<code>--fileroot &lt;string&gt;</code> &ndash; 
The <code>fileroot</code> string will be added as a prefix to all
output file names. Default = none.</li>

<li>
<code>--output-dir &lt;filename&gt;</code> &ndash; 
The name of the directory where output files will be created.
Default = crux-output.</li>

<li>
<code>--overwrite &lt;T|F&gt;</code> &ndash;
Replace existing files if true (T) or fail when trying to overwrite a
file if false (F). Default =  F.</li>


<li>
<code>--parameter-file &lt;filename&gt;</code> &ndash; A file
containing command-line or additional parameters.  See
the <a href="parameter-file.html">parameter documentation</a> page for
details.  Default = no parameter file.</li>

<li>
<code>--verbosity &lt;0-100&gt;</code> &ndash; 
Specify the verbosity of the current processes. Each level prints the
following messages, including all those at lower verbosity levels:
0-fatal errors, 10-non-fatal errors, 20-warnings, 30-information on
the progress of execution, 40-more progress information, 50-debug
info, 60-detailed debug info. Default = 30.</li>

<!-- Other parameters
<li>
<code>--no-split T|F</code> - user can decide not to divide the spectrum into windows. 
    Only good for specialized, small spectra. Leave this at FALSE.<br>
</li>
<li>
<code>--xml-output T|F</code> - write the output to an xml file. 
    This was a user request because they had an xml parser they liked.
</li>
<li>
<code>--zero-intensity-values T|F</code> - For processed spectra (Thermo spectra), 
   a lot of intensity data points are represented as zeros. You can choose to 
   include these in your Hardklor analysis. I do not recommend it, leave this at FALSE.
</li>
<li>
<code>--custom-molecule &lt;atomic formula%gt;</code> - instead of using averagine, 
search your data for a specific molecule. This is generally not useful for shotgun data. 
</li>
<li>
<code>--signal-to-noise-algorithm STD|ASN|AVG</code> - Use a different signal to noise algorithm.
The published algorithm (and default) has the code STD (for standard). I have a few others: 
1. ASN, advanced signal to noise, 2. AVG, boxcar averaging, 3. MIX, combines ASN and AVG. 
There are also codes of V2, V2ASN, and V2MIX that can be used, but they require a much longer 
and separate discussion. After you have finished making your initial tests, ask me about these 
options again as they are probably what can be toggled to best improve your results.
</li>
<li>
-ppMatch, -ppm, and -ppWin are all parameters for use with ASN and MIX above.
</li>

<code>--reference-filter &lt;string&rt;</code> - Can filter out spectra based on the 
reference line in the spectrum header. 

Here's my recommended settings for overriding default values:

-d 2
-corr 0.90
-sl 3
-sn 0
-win 5.25
-p 12
-da true
