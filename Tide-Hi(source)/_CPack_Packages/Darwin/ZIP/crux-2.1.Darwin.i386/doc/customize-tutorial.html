<h1>Customization and search options</h1>

<p><span class="prog">Crux</span> allows the user the flexibility to
change many of the search and analysis parameters.  Attributes like
the output format and which peptides are selected from the protein
database are controlled through numerous options.  This page
starts with some general information about options and then describe
the use of some key <span class="prog">crux</span> options.
</p>

<a name="intro"></a>
<h2>Introduction to options</h2>

<p>
A <span class="prog">crux</span> command is made up of four parts:
executable name, command, options, and required arguments. Let's use
a <span class="prog">crux tide-search</span> command as an example.
Here is the general form.</p>

<div class="code"><code>
$ crux tide-search [options] &lt;mass spectra&gt; &lt;peptide index&gt;
</code>
</div>

<p>
In this case, the command is <span class="prog">tide-search</span>.
This is followed by zero or more optional arguments.  Finally, the
required arguments, listed above inside angle brackets, include the
name of the file containing the spectra to be identified and the name
of a peptide index produced previously by
the <span class="prog">tide-index</span> command.</p>

<p>
All of the available options are described for each command on
the <a href="crux.html">documentation</a> pages.  You can also get a
list of available options by running a command with no arguments.
For example, the command</p>

<div class="code"><code>
$ crux tide-search</code>
</div>

<p>
will produce output that looks like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
bash-3.2$ ~/proj/crux/trunk/src/c/crux tide-search
FATAL: Error in command line. Error # 5
The required argument &lt;tide spectra file&gt; is missing.

USAGE:

   crux tide-search [options] &lt;tide spectra file&gt; &lt;tide database index&gt; 

REQUIRED ARGUMENTS:

  &lt;tide spectra file&gt; The name of the file from which to parse the fragmentation spectra, in any of the file formats supported by ProteoWizard. Alternatively, the argument may be a binary spectrum file produced by a previous run of crux tide-search using the store-spectra parameter.
  &lt;tide database index&gt; A directory containing a database index created by a previous run of crux tide-index.

OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS:

  [--precursor-window &lt;double&gt;]
     Search peptides within +/- 'precursor-window' of the spectrum mass. 
     Definition of precursor window depends upon precursor-window-type.
     Default=3.0.
  [--precursor-window-type &lt;string&gt;]
     Window type to use for selecting candidate peptides. 
     &lt;string&gt;=mass|mz|ppm. Default=mass.
  [--spectrum-min-mz &lt;double&gt;]
     The lowest spectrum m/z to search. Default=0.0.
  [--spectrum-max-mz &lt;double&gt;]
     The highest spectrum m/z to search. Default=no maximum.
  [--min-peaks &lt;int&gt;]
     The minimum number of peaks a spectrum must have for it to be
     searched. Default=20.
...
</pre>

<p>The first three lines are telling you that you forgot the required
arguments and are reminding you what they are.  The following lines
list all the options (only five of which are shown
above).  <span class="prog">Crux</span> options all begin with two
dashes followed by the option name.  The name is followed by a space
and the appropriate argument.  This example increases the verbosity to
40:
</p>

<div class="code"><code>
$ crux tide-search --verbosity 40 sample.ms2 yeast.fasta</code>
</div>

<a name="file"></a>
<h2>Specifying options via a parameter file</h2>

<p>
The second option listed
above, <span class="out">--parameter-file</span>, is available for all
Crux commands.  The parameter file allows multiple options to be
specified in a file.  All of the command line options can be put in a
parameter file, but the format is slightly different.  In the
parameter file, the two leading dashes are removed from the option
name, and the option name and value must be separated by an equal sign
instead of a space:
</p>
<div class=code><code>
&lt;option name&gt;=&lt;argument&gt;</code>
</div>

<p>
The above example, in which we changed the verbosity, would look like this
in a parameter file:</p>

<div class="code"><code>
verbosity=40
</div>

<p>
The parameter file allows only one option per line.  Lines beginning
with "#" are considered comments and are ignored.  A sample parameter
file can be found <a href="parameter-file.html">here</a>.  Command
line and parameter file options may be used separately or together.
If an option is specified in both places, then value on the command
line will be used.
</p>

<p>
During execution of any Crux command, a parameter file containing the
name and value of all the options for the current operation
will be automatically be saved in the output directory.  Note that not
all parameters in the file may have been used in the operation.  The
parameter file will be named
<code>&lt;command&gt;.params.txt</code>,
where <code>&lt;tag&gt;</code> is the name of the command that was
executed.</p>

<a name="shared"></a>
<h2>Shared options</h2>

<p>
In addition to <code>--parameter-file</code>, Crux includes several 
other options that are shared across all, or nearly all, Crux commands.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>--output-dir &lt;filename&gt;</code> &ndash; 
The name of the directory where output files will be created.
Default = crux-output.</li>

<li>
<code>--fileroot &lt;string&gt;</code> &ndash; 
The <code>fileroot</code> string will be added as a prefix to all
output file names. Default = none.</li>

<li>
<code>--overwrite &lt;T|F&gt;</code> &ndash; By default, if Crux
detects that the output file it is about to produce already exists,
then Crux will exit with an error.  This option allows Crux to
overwrite existing files.</li>

<li>
<code>--verbosity &lt;0-100&gt;</code> &ndash; Specify the verbosity
of the current command. Each level prints the following messages,
including all those at lower verbosity levels: 0-fatal errors,
10-non-fatal errors, 20-warnings, 30-information on the progress of
execution, 40-more progress information, 50-debug info, 60-detailed
debug info. Default = 30.</li>

<li>
In addition, many Crux commands include various options of the form
<code>--&lt;format&gt;-output</code>.  These options take Boolean
arguments (specified as "T" or "F") and indicate whether output files
in the specified format should be produced.  For example, in addition
to tab-delimited text format, <code>tide-search</code> can produce
output in PepXML, MZid, SQT and PINxml formats.</li>

</ul>

<a name="index"></a>
<h2>Changing the indexing and searching parameters</h2>

<p>
Various options to <span class="prog">tide-index</span> control how
the proteins in the database are converted to peptides.  These options
fall into several categories, allowing specification of peptide
properties such as minimum and maximum length, enzymatic digestion
rules, decoy database generation and specification of various static
and variable modifications.  These options are fully
documented <a href="tide-index.html">here</a>.  Similarly,
the <code><a href="tide-search.html">tide-search</a></code>
documentation describes options for selecting which spectra to score,
the rules for selecting candidate peptides for a given spectrum, and
for deciding what kinds of scores to report.</p>
