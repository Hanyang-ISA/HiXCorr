<h2>Description:</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>
Given a collection of scored peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs), estimate
two statistical confidence measures for each: a q-value and a
posterior error probability (PEP).</p>

<h3>q-value</h3>

<p>
The q-value is analogous to a p-value but incorporates false discovery
rate multiple testing correction.  The q-value associated with a score
threshold T is defined as the minimal false discovery rate at which a
score of T is deemed significant.  In this setting, the q-value
accounts for the fact that we are analyzing a large collection of
PSMs.</p>

<!--
<p>
The q-values may be estimated in two different ways, depending on
how the search was executed:</p>

<ol>

<li>
If the collection of PSMs has p-values assigned
by <code>tide-search</code> by using the
<code>--compute-p-values</code> option, then the false discovery rate
associated with a given score is computed using the Benjamini-Hochberg
algorithm (<i>Journal of the Royal Statistical Society B</i>,
57:289-300, 1995).  Briefly, the algorithm is as follows: (1) rank
all <i>m</i> PSMs by p-value; (2) for a p-value <i>p<sub>j</sub></i>
that appears at position <i>j</i> in the ranked list, the FDR is
estimated as <i>p<sub>j</sub> * (m/j)</i>.</li>

<li>
Alternatively, if the collection of PSMs does not have p-values
assigned, 
-->

<p>
To estimate q-values, <code>calibrate-scores</code> searches the input
directory for a corresponding set of decoy PSMs.  The false discovery
rate associated with a given score is estimated as the number of decoy
scores above the threshold divided by the number of target scores
above the threshold, multiplied by the ratio of the total number of
targets to total number of decoys.  This methodology is described in
the following article:
<blockquote>
Lukas K&auml;ll, John D. Storey, Michael J. MacCoss and William
Stafford
Noble.  <a href="http://noble.gs.washington.edu/papers/kall2008assigning.html">"Assigning
significance to peptides identified by tandem mass spectrometry using
decoy databases."</a> <i>Journal of Proteome Research</i>. 7(1):29-34,
2008.</blockquote>
Note that calibrate-scores does not (yet) estimate the percentage of
incorrect targets, as described in the above article.  Hence, the
method implemented here as "decoy q-values" is analogous to the
"Simple FDR" procedure shown in Figure 4A of the above article.</li>

</ol>

<p>
In each case, the estimated FDRs are converted to q-values by ranking
the PSMs by score and then taking, for each PSM, the minimum of the
current FDR and all of the FDRs below it in the ranked list.
<!--
 The two
types of q-values are reported, respectively, in columns with headers
"Weibull q-value" or "decoy q-value".
-->
</p>

<h3>Posterior error probability</h3>

<p>
Unlike the q-value, which is calculated with respect to the collection
of PSMs with scores above a specified threshold, the PEP (also known
in the literature as the "local FDR") is calculated with respect to a
single score. The PEP is the probability that a particular PSM is
incorrect.  Crux's PEPs are estimated using the methodology described
in this article:</p>

Noble. <a href="http://noble.gs.washington.edu/papers/kall2008nonparametric.html">"Non-parametric
estimation of posterior error probabilities associated with peptides
identified by tandem mass spectrometry."</a> <i>Bioinformatics
(Proceedings of the ECCB)</i>. 24(16):i42-i48, 2008.</blockquote>

<h2>Input:</h2>

<UL>

<li>
<b>&lt;search&nbsp;results&gt;</b> &ndash; A collection of target and
decoy peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs)
in <a href="txt-format.html">Crux tab-delimited text</a>.  Decoy PSMs
can be provided in two ways: either as a separate file or embedded
within the same file as the target PSMs.  Crux will first search for
target PSMs in a separate file.  The decoy file name is constructed
from the target name by replacing "target" with "decoy."  For example,
if <code>tide-search.target.txt</code> is provided as input, then Crux will
search for a corresponding file named <code>tide-search.decoy.txt</code>.
If no decoy file is found, then Crux will assume that the given input
file contains a mix of target and decoy PSMs.  Within this file,
decoys are identified using a prefix (specified
via <code>--decoy-prefix</code>) on the protein name.</p></li>

<li>
<b>&lt;column&nbsp;name&gt;</b> &ndash; The name of the column from
which to extract the score.</li>

</UL>

<h2>Output:</h2>

<ul>

<p>
The program writes files to the folder <code>crux-output</code> by
default.  The name of the output folder can be set by the user using
the <code>--output-dir</code> option.  The following files will be
created:</p>

<li>
<b>calibrate-scores.target.txt</b>: a tab-delimited text file
containing the PSMs. See <a href="txt-format.html">txt file format</a>
for a list of the fields.  The file will contain two additional columns, named "&lt;column name&gt; q-value" and "&lt;column name&gt; PEP" where "&lt;column name&gt;" is provided on the command line.</li>

<li>
<b>calibrate-scores.log.txt</b>: a log file containing a copy of all
messages that were printed to stderr.</li>

<li>
<b>calibrate-scores.params.txt</b>: a file containing the name and
value of all parameters/options for the current operation.  Not all
parameters in the file may have been used in the operation.  The
resulting file can be used with the <code>--parameter-file</code>
option for other crux programs.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Options:</h2>

<UL>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<li>
<code>--decoy-prefix &lt;string&gt;</code> &ndash;
Specifies what protein name prefix is used to indicate a decoy.
Default = "decoy_".</li>

<li>
<code>--pi-zero &lt;value&gt;</code> &ndash;
The estimated proportion of target scores that are drawn according to
the null distribution.  Default=1.0.</li>

<!--
<li>
<code>--mod-mass-format &lt;mod-only|total|separate&gt;</code> &ndash;
Specify how sequence modifications are reported in various ouptut
files and, consequently, how they should be read in by
calibrate-scores.  Use the same value as was used in the search. </li>
-->

<h3>Input and output</h3>

<li>
<code>--fileroot &lt;string&gt;</code> &ndash; 
The <code>fileroot</code> string will be added as a prefix to all
output file names. Default = none.</li>

<li>
<code>--output-dir &lt;filename&gt;</code> &ndash; 
The name of the directory where output files will be created.
Default = crux-output.</li>

<li>
<code>--overwrite &lt;T|F&gt;</code> &ndash;
Replace existing files if true (T) or fail when trying to overwrite a
file if false (F). Default =  F.

<li>
<code>--parameter-file &lt;filename&gt;</code> &ndash; 
A file containing command-line or additional parameters.  See the <a
href=parameter-file.html>parameter documentation</a> page for details.</li>

<LI>
<code>--verbosity &lt;0-100&gt;</code> &ndash; 
Specify the verbosity of the current processes. Each level prints the
following messages, including all those at lower verbosity levels:
0-fatal errors, 10-non-fatal errors, 20-warnings, 30-information on
the progress of execution, 40-more progress information, 50-debug
info, 60-detailed debug info. Default = 30.

</UL>

<!--
<p>
Currently, this specification differs from the implementation in Crux in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>
The program outputs files named qvalue.* rather than calibrate-scores.*.</li>
<li>
Rather than allowing the user to specify a column name, the program has built-in column names that it searches for (first for XCorr p-value and then for XCorr).</li>
</ul>
