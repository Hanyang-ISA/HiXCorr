<h1>Running a Simple Search Using Tide and Percolator</h1>

<p>
Now that you have your environment <a href="start-tutorial.html">set
up</a> and the two input files in your working directory, you can
conduct the search. The search process compares each spectrum
in <span class=file>demo.ms2</span> to peptides (subsequences of the
proteins) in fasta files provided in a
dirctory, <span class=file>yeast-index/</span>.  Peptides whose
precursor mass is close to that of the observed spectrum are scored
against that spectrum, and the top scores are reported in the output.
To conduct the search, we first create a peptide index
using <code>tide-index</code> and then execute the search
using <code>tide-search</code>.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<div class=code>
<code>$ crux tide-index small-yeast.fasta yeast-index </code>
</div>

<p>
While generating the peptide index, you will see output like this:</p>

<pre>
INFO: Beginning tide-index.
INFO: Writing results to output directory 'crux-output'.
INFO: CPU: Genomes-MacBook-Pro.local
INFO: Wed Dec 18 11:12:00 SGT 2013

INFO: Reading proteins
INFO: Precomputing theoretical spectra...
INFO: Elapsed time: 0.293 s
INFO: Finished crux tide-index.
INFO: Return Code:0
</pre>

<p>
This command produces the peptide index in <code>yeast-index</code>
and also produces a directory <code>crux-output</code> containing 
the following files:
<ul>

<li>
tide-index.decoy.fasta &ndash; a set of decoy proteins, derived from
the proteins in the input set,</li>

<li>
tide-search.params.txt &ndash; a record of all the parameters used in
the search, and</li>

<li>tide-search.log.txt &ndash; a log file containing a copy of all
  the messages printed to the screen during the search.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Now you can run this command:</p></li>

<div class=code>
<li><code>$ crux tide-search --compute-sp T demo.ms2 yeast-index</code>
</div>

<p>While the search is running, you will see output like this:</p>

<pre>
INFO: Beginning tide-search.
WARNING: The output directory 'crux-output' already exists.

</pre>

<p>
The <span class=file>crux-output</span> directory now contains four new files
containing the search results: 
<ul>

<li>
tide-search.target.txt &ndash; search results
in <a href="txt-format.html">tab-delimited format</a>.</li>

<li>
tide-search.decoy.txt &ndash; search results from a decoy database
in <a href="txt-format.html">tab-delimited format</a>.</li>

<li>
tide-search.params.txt &ndash; a record of all the parameters used in
the search.</li>

<li>tide-search.log.txt &ndash; a log file containing a copy of all
  the messages printed to the screen during the search.</li>
</ul>

</p>
</li>

<p>
The final step is to post-process the search results using Percolator.
Each spectrum has been compared to many peptides and we would like to
return only the best match for each spectrum.  We also expect that
some fraction of the spectra will not be identifiable as peptides (due
to chemical noise, multiple peptides co-eluting, poor fragmentation,
etc.).  The analysis step filters out those spectra and ranks the
matches by quality.
</p></li>
<li>
<div class=code><code>
$ crux percolator crux-output/search.target.txt</code>
</div>

<p>While the analysis is running, you will see output like this

<p>
In this output, the PSMs are ranked by "percolator score," with higher
scores indicating a higher quality match. The associated statistical
confidence estimate is reported as a "percolator q-value," interpreted
as the minimal false discovery rate threshold at which this match is
deemed significant.  In the list above, all of the matches have
q-values of 0, meaning that they are highly significant.
The meanings of the remaining columns are
described <a href="txt-format.html">here</a>.</p>
