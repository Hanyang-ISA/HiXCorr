<h1>Crux Installation Instructions</h1>

<p/>
This page will walk you through the steps of
installing <span class=prog>crux<span/> on your computer.
Seperate sections describe the installation for 
<a href="#LINUX">Linux</a>,
<a href="#OSX">OS X</a>,
and
<a href="#WINDOWS">Windows</a>.
You have the choice of installing precompiled binaries or building
Crux from the source code.
The compiled binaries offer the easiest installation option.  

<a name="LINUX"></a>
<h2>Linux</h2>
<b>Note:</b> when typing the commands shown in these instructions
do not type the
leading <code>$</code> before each command; it indicates the
prompt. These instructions will refer to your home directory as
<code>$HOME</code>.  You can type <code>$HOME</code> in the commands
or you can use the fully qualified path to your home directory which
may be something like <code>/home/yourname/</code>.  Note that you can
find out the location of your home directory by logging in and
typing <code>pwd</code> or <code>echo $HOME</code>.
<h3>Installing Pre-compiled Crux Binaries on Linux</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Download the files</b> 
<p/>
<span class=prog>Crux</span> is freely
available for download under an
<a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache 2.0 license</a>.  
On the download page click on the link "Linux [architecture]
Build (zipped)" to download them to your computer.
If your computer is running a 32-bit version of Linux select the
i686 version.
If your computer is running a 64-bit version of Linux select the
x86_64 version.
If a window pops
up, select the "Save" button.
To check that the file was
transfered correctly, run this command

<div class=code><code>
$ md5sum <i>[downloaded file]</i></code>
</div>
<p/>
and compare the output to the "MD5 checksum" link next to the file you
downloaded.  
<p/>
</li>

<li><b>Unpack and install the files</b>
<p/>
The file you downloaded
should be named something like 
<span class=file>crux-x.xx-XXXX-GNU-Linux.zip</span>
where <span class=file>x.xx</span>
is replaced with the most current release version.
and 
<span class=file>XXXX</span> is either i686 or x86_64.
Move this file 
to a convenient location and unpack the file with this command.

<div class=code><code>
$ unzip crux-x.xx-XXXX-GNU-Linux.zip</code>
</div>
<p/>
You should now have a new directory,
<span class=file>crux-x.xx-XXXX-GNU-Linux</span>,
with two subdirectories <span class=file>bin</span>, and <span
class=file>doc</span>.  The <span class=prog>crux</span> programs are
in the <span class=file>bin</span> directory. You may want to move 
these files somewhere
more convenient for you, but otherwise, that completes the
installation!  Skip ahead to 
<a href="#linux_path">Setting the PATH on Linux and OS X</a>
for notes on how to run the executables.
</ul>
<h3>Building Crux From Source on Linux</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Prerequisites</b>
<p/>
To build Crux from source on Linux you must have installed the
following software:
<ul>
<li><code>gcc</code></li>
<li><code>g++</code></li>
<li><code>cmake</code></li>
<li><code>make</code></li>
<li><code>svn</code></li>
<li><code>wget</code> (must support SSL)</li>
</ul>
<p/>
Building <span class=prog>crux</span> also requires the
<a href="http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net"><span class=prog>Proteowizard</span></a>
and 
<a href="http://per-colator.com"><span class=prog>Percolator</span></a>
libraries. 
These will automatically be copied from the <span class=prog>Proteowizard</span>
and <span class=prog>Percolator</span>
repositories and statically linked into <span class=prog>crux</span>.

<li><b>Download the files</b> 
<p/>
The <span class=prog>Crux</span> source is freely
available for download under an
<a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache 2.0 license></a>.  
On the download page click on the link "Source (tarred, gzipped)",
and choose save to disk if prompted. 
To check that the file was
transfered correctly, run this command

<div class=code><code>
$ md5sum <i>[downloaded file]</i></code>
</div>
<p/>
and compare the output to the "MD5 checksum" link next to the file you
selected on the Crux download page.  
<p/>
The file you downloaded should be named something like 
<span class=file>crux-x.xx.source.tar.gz</span>, 
where <span class=file>x.xx</span>
is replaced with the most current release version.
<li><b>Unpack the files</b>
<p/>
Move the downloaded file to a
convenient location and unpack it with this command.

<div class=code>
$ tar -zxvf crux-x.xx.Source.tar.gz
</div>
A new directory named <span class=file>crux-x.xx.Source</span> will be
created and a long list of files will stream by as they are being put
into the new directory.
<p/>
</li>

<li><b>Configure the build</b> 
<p/>
Move into the <span class=file>crux-x.xx.Source</span>
directory from step 1.
Run the command
<div class=code><code>
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=&lt;install directory&gt; .
</code>
</div>
<p/>
where <span class=file>&lt;install directory&gt;</span> is
the location where you wish to install the <span class=prog>crux</span> programs. 
If you want <span class=prog>crux</span> to go in <span class=file>$HOME/bin</span>,
then <span class=file>&lt;install directory&gt;</span> would be <span class=file>$HOME</span>.
The installation process will automatically put the programs in a directory called
<span class=file>bin</span>.
<p/>
Note, this configuration will build with optimizations turned on,
and will not include debug symbols.
To build with optimizations turned off,
and debug symbols included,
use the command:
<div class=code><code>
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=&lt;install directory&gt; .
</code>
</div>
</li>
<p/>
<li><b>Build and install</b>
<p/>
To complete the process, run these two commands.</li>
<div class=code><code>
$ make<br>
$ make install
</code>
</div>
<p/>
The <span class=prog>crux</span> programs are
in the <span class=file>bin</span> subdirectory
of the
<span class=file>&lt;install directory&gt;</span>
That completes the installation!  Skip ahead to 
<a href="#linux_path">Setting the PATH on Linux and OS X</a>
for notes on how to run the executables.
</ul>
<a name="OSX"></a>
<h2>OS X</h2>
<b>Note:</b> 
when typing the commands shown in these instructions do not type the
leading <code>$</code> before each command; it indicates the
prompt. These instructions will refer to your home directory as
<code>$HOME</code>.  You can type <code>$HOME</code> in the commands
or you can use the fully qualified path to your home directory which
may be something like <code>/home/yourname/</code>.  Note that you can
find out the location of your home directory by logging in and
typing <code>pwd</code> or <code>echo $HOME</code>.
<p/>
To install and use <code>crux</code> on OS X
you'll need to be familiar with the <span class=code>Terminal</span>
application.
<h3>Installing Pre-compiled Crux Binaries on OS X</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Download the files</b> 
<p/>
<span class=prog>Crux</span> is freely

<div class=code><code>
$ md5 <i>[downloaded file]</i></code>
</div>
<p/>
and compare the output to the "MD5 checksum" link next to the file you
downloaded.  
<p/>
</li>

<li><b>Unpack and install the files</b>
<p/>
The file you downloaded
should be named something like 
<span class=file>crux-x.xx.Darwin.x86_64.zip</span>
where <span class=file>x.xx</span>
is replaced with the most current release version.
Move this file 
to a convenient location and unpack the file with this command.

<div class=code><code>
$ unzip crux-x.xx.Darwin.x86_64.zip</code>
</div>
<p/>
You should now have a new directory,
<span class=file>crux-x.xx.Darwin.x86_64</span>,
with two subdirectories <span class=file>bin</span>, and <span
class=file>doc</span>.  The <span class=prog>crux</span> programs are
in the <span class=file>bin</span> directory. You may want to move 
these files somewhere
more convenient for you, but otherwise, that completes the

<h3>Building Crux From Source on OS X</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Prerequisites</b>
<p/>
To build Crux from source on OS X you must have installed the
following software:
<ul>
<li><code>gcc</code></li>
<li><code>g++</code></li>
<li><code>cmake</code></li>
<li><code>make</code></li>
<li><code>svn</code></li>
<li><code>wget</code> (must support SSL)</li>
</ul>
<p/>
Building <span class=prog>crux</span> also requires the
<a href="http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net"><span class=prog>Proteowizard</span></a>
and 
<a href="http://per-colator.com"><span class=prog>Percolator</span></a>
libraries. 
These will automatically be copied from the <span class=prog>Proteowizard</span>
and <span class=prog>Percolator</span>
repositories and statically linked into <span class=prog>crux</span>.
<p />
The C++ compiler that comes with Apples's <span class=prog>XCode</span>
is partially incompatible with the GNU 
<span class=prog>C++</span> compilers
and can't compile some parts of <span class=prog>crux</span> and the supporting libraries.
If you are building on OS X 
you will need to install a copy of the GNU C and C++ compilers
from a repository such as <a href="http://www.macports.org">MacPorts</a>.
We have used version 4.7 of the GNU <span class=prog>g++</span> compiler
downloaded from <a href="http://www.macports.org">MacPorts</a>.
Once you've installed 
<a href="http://www.macports.org">MacPorts</a>
the commands to install the GNU C and C++ compilers is
<div class=code>
<code>
$ sudo port install gcc47
</code>
</div>
<p />
<a href="http://www.macports.org">MacPorts</a>
allows you to install multiple versions of the GNU compilers.
You'll want to set your prefered version as the default for MacPorts.
Fo example:
<div class=code>
<code>
$ sudo port select --set gcc mp-gcc47
</code>
</div>
<p />
You will also have to configure your environment to use the MacPorts compilers.
This is done using the environment variables
<span class=prog>PATH</span>, which sets the list of directories
that are searched for executables,
<span class=prog>CC</span>, which identifies the C compiler,
and
<span class=prog>CXX</span>, which identifies the C++ compiler.
Before staring your build set these environment variables to point
to the MacPorts compilers.
For example:
<div class=code>
<code>
$ export PATH=/opt/local/bin:$PATH
<br/>
$ export CC=/opt/local/bin/gcc
<br/>
$ export CXX=/opt/local/bin/g++
</code>
</div>
<p/>
You may want to include these commands in your 
<span class=file>.profile</span>
or
<span class=file>.bashrc</span>.
<p/>
<span class=prog>cmake</span>,
<span class=prog>svn</span>,
and
<span class=prog>wget</span>,
can also be installed from MacPorts.
Note that you must install the <span class=prog>ssl</span> variant of 
<span class=prog>wget</span>:
<div class=code>
<code>
$ sudo port install wget +ssl
</code>
</div>
<p/>
<li><b>Download the files</b> 
<p/>
The <span class=prog>Crux</span> source is freely
available for download under an
<a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache 2.0 license></a>.  
On the download page click on the link "Source (tarred, gzipped)",
and choose save to disk if prompted. 
To check that the file was
transfered correctly, run this command

<div class=code><code>
$ md5sum <i>[downloaded file]</i></code>
</div>
<p/>
and compare the output to the "MD5 checksum" link next to the file you
selected on the Crux download page.  
<p/>
The file you downloaded should be named something like 
<span class=file>crux-x.xx.source.tar.gz</span>, 
where <span class=file>x.xx</span>
is replaced with the most current release version.
<li><b>Unpack the files</b>
<p/>
Move the downloaded file to a
convenient location and unpack it with this command.

<div class=code>
$ tar -zxvf crux-x.xx.Source.tar.gz
</div>
A new directory named <span class=file>crux-x.xx.Source</span> will be
created and a long list of files will stream by as they are being put
into the new directory.
<p/>
</li>

<li><b>Configure the build</b> 
<p/>
Move into the <span class=file>crux-x.xx.Source</span>
directory from step 1.
Run the command
<div class=code><code>
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=&lt;install directory&gt; .
</code>
</div>
<p/>
where <span class=file>&lt;install directory&gt;</span> is
the location where you wish to install the <span class=prog>crux</span> programs. 
If you want <span class=prog>crux</span> to go in <span class=file>$HOME/bin</span>,
then <span class=file>&lt;install directory&gt;</span> would be <span class=file>$HOME</span>.
The installation process will automatically put the programs in a directory called
<span class=file>bin</span>.
<p/>
Note, this configuration will build with optimizations turned on,
and will not include debug symbols.
To build with optimizations turned off,
and debug symbols included,
use the command:
<div class=code><code>
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=&lt;install directory&gt; .
</code>
</div>
</li>
<p/>
<li><b>Build and install</b>
<p/>
To complete the process, run these two commands.</li>
<div class=code><code>
$ make<br>
$ make install
</code>
</div>
<p/>
The <span class=prog>crux</span> programs are
in the <span class=file>bin</span> subdirectory
of the
<span class=file>&lt;install directory&gt;</span>
That completes the installation!  Skip ahead to 
<a href="#linux_path">Setting the PATH on Linux and OS X</a>
for notes on how to run the executables.
</ul>

<a name="linux_path"></a>
<h2>Setting the PATH on Linux and OS X</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p/>
On Linux and OS X systems you can always run any of the programs by specifying its full
path.  For example,</p>

<div class=code><code>
$ <em>&lt;install directory&gt;</em>/bin/crux search-for-matches</code>
</div>

<p>In this final step of the installation, we'll set things up so that
you can also run any of the programs by just typing its name.  This is
done with an environment variable called <span
class=code>$PATH</span>.  <span class=code>$PATH</span> is a list of
places that the computer looks for executable programs.  Find out what
is in the current list with this command:

<div class=code><code>
$ echo $PATH</code><br>
</div>
<p>The value returned might look something like this:
<code>
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/games
</code>
<p>The first directory in this colon-separated list, <span
class=out>/usr/local/bin</span>, is the first place the computer looks
for a program.  If it doesn't find the program there it tries <span
class=out>/usr/bin</span> and so on down the list.  You can either
move the crux executable files into one of these directories already
in your PATH, or you can add <span
class=code><em>&lt;install directory&gt;</em></span> to PATH with this
command.  (Remember to replace the word <em>&lt;install directory&gt;</em> with the
actual location of your installation)</p> 

<div class=code><code>
$ export PATH=$PATH:&lt;install directory&gt;/bin</code>
</div>

<p>Try '<span class=code>echo $PATH</span>' again to see that the
change was made.  <em>&lt;install directory&gt;/bin</em> should be at the end of the
list.  Now you can 
run the <span class=prog>crux</span> programs by just typing their
names.  Try this.</p>

<div class=code><code>
$ crux search-for-matches</code>
</div>

<p>The change to <span class=code>$PATH</span> is only temporary.  As
soon as you close the window, the change will disappear.  In order to
make the change every time you log on, add the line <span
class=code>export PATH=$PATH:&lt;install directory&gt;/bin</span> to the file <span
class=out>.bashrc</span> located in your home directory.  You will
have to log on again for the change to take effect.

<h3>Building Crux From Source on Windows</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Prerequisites</b>
<p/>
To build Crux from source on Windows you must have installed the
following software:
<ul>
<li><code>
<a
href="http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs#DownloadFamilies_4">Microsoft
Visual C++ 2010</a></code></li>
<li><code>
<a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23691">Microsoft
Visual C++ 2010 Service Pack 1</a></code></li>
<li><a
href="http://sjsupport.thermofinnigan.com/public/detail.asp?id=703"><code>Thermo
32-bit MSFileReader</code></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html"><code>CMake</code></a></li>
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32svn/"><code>SVN</code></a></li>
<li><a href="http://getgnuwin32.sourceforge.net"><code>wget</code> (must support SSL)</a></li>
</ul>
<p/>
<b>Other verions of Visual Studio will not be able to build Crux!</b>
You must have Visual Studio 2010, and you must install Service Pack 1.
The Express version of Visual Studio 2010 does work.
<p/>
<span class=code>wget</span> is available as part of the GnuWin32 package.
The easiest way to install this is via the 
<a href="http://getgnuwin32.sourceforge.net"><code>GetGnuWin32</code></a>
package manager.
<span class=code>wget</span> must support SSL, so install the optional
packages provided by
<a href="http://getgnuwin32.sourceforge.net"><code>GetGnuWin32</code></a> .
<p/>
<span class=code>wget</span> and 
<span class=code>svn</span> must be included in the execution PATH
for your system.
See the section <i>Setting the PATH on Windows</i> for more information.
<p/>
<li><b>Download the file</b> 
<p/>
The <span class=prog>Crux</span> source is freely
available for download under an
<a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache 2.0 license></a>.  
On the download page click on the link "Source (zipped)",
and choose save to disk if prompted. 
<p/>
The file you downloaded should be named something like 
<span class=file>crux-x.xx.Source.zip</span>, 
where <span class=file>x.xx</span>
is replaced with the most current release version.
<p />
<li><b>Unpack the files</b> 
<p />
Unpack the downloaded file using Windows Explorer.
Right click on the file icon and click on "Extract All ...".
A new directory named <span class=file>crux-x.xx.Source</span> will be
created containing the source code and documentation for Crux.
<p/>
<b>Note</b> Windows has a fixed maximum path length of 270 characters.
The Crux build creates several levels of directories so it
is very easy to exceed this limit. 
This will cause the build to fail.
To avoid this problem we recommend keeping the Crux source and build trees 
very near the disk root (typically
<span class=code>C:\</span>

</li>
<li>
<p/>
<b>Open the command line development environment.</b>
<p/>
Under the "Start" button
open the "Visual Studio 2010" folder, then open the "Visual Studio Tools"
folder, and double-click on "Visual Studio x64 Win64 Command Prompt".
This will launch a 
<span class=file>cmd</span> shell configured to use the 
Microsoft development tools.
</li>
<li><b>Configure</b> 
<p/>
In the <span class=file>cmd</span> shell  you just opened,
move into the <span class=file>crux-x.xx.Source</span>
directory from step 1.
Run the command
<div class=code><code>
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=&lt;install directory&gt; -G "Visual Studio 10" .
</code>
</div>
<p/>
where <span class=file>&lt;install directory&gt;</span> is
the location where you wish to install the <span class=prog>crux</span> programs. 
<p/>
<li><b>Build and install</b> 
<p/>
To complete the process run the command</li>
<div class=code><code>
cmake --build . --config Release --target ALL_BUILD
</code>
<p/>
Once you've run the configuration step
you can also build and debug Crux from within the Visual Studio IDE.
CMake will generate a file named
<span class=file>crux.sln</span>. 
Open this file in Visual Studio.
You can select the build configuration: Release or Debug
in the combo box under the menu bar.
<p/>
<b>Note</b> The Crux build will not automatically generate
debugging symbols even if you've selected the Debug configuration.
Right click on the Crux folder in the "Solution Explorer" and
select "Properties" from the pop-up menu.
In the "Properties" page select the "Debugging" item under the "Linker"
properties. Set "Generate Debug Info" to "Yes".
<p/>
Changes made to the Visual Studio solution and project files will be lost
the next time CMake regenerates the project.

<h2>Setting the PATH on Windows</h2>
<ul>
<li>
On Windows systems you can always run any of the programs by specifying its full
path.  For example,</p>

<div class=code><code>
C:\ <em>&lt;install directory&gt;</em>\bin\crux search-for-matches</code>
</div>

<p>In this final step of the installation, we'll set things up so that
you can also run any of the programs by just typing its name.  This is
done with an environment variable called <span
class=code>PATH</span>.  <span class=code>PATH</span> is a list of
directoires that the computer looks for executable programs.  Find out what
is in the current list with this command:
<p/>
<div class=code><code>
C:\ echo %PATH%</code><br>
</div>
<p/>
<p>The value returned might look something like this:
<p/>
<div class=code><code>

</div>
<p>The first directory in this semicolon-separated list, <span
class=out>C:\Windows</span>, is the first place the computer looks
for a program.  If it doesn't find the program there it tries <span
class=out>C:\WIndows\system32</span> and so on down the list.  You can either
move the crux executable files into one of these directories already
in your PATH, or you can add <span
class=code><em>&lt;install directory&gt;</em></span> to PATH with this
command.  (Remember to replace the word <em>&lt;install directory&gt;</em> with the
actual location of your installation)</p>
