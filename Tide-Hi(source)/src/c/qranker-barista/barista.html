<p>
<b>Description:</b></p>

<p>
Barista is a protein identification algorithm that combines two
different tasks&mdash;peptide-spectrum match (PSM) verification and
protein inference&mdash;into a single learning algorithm.  The program
requires two inputs: the results of a database search and a database
of proteins.  Barista produces as output a ranking of proteins based
on how likely they are to be present in the sample.  Barista also
re-ranks the peptide identifications to more accurately distinguish
between correct and incorrect identifications.  Barista uses a machine
learning strategy that requires that the database search be carried
out on target and decoy proteins.</p>

<p>
<b>Usage:</b></p>

<blockquote>
<code>crux barista [options] &lt;protein&nbsp;database&nbsp;folder&gt; &lt;sqt folder&gt; &lt;ms2 folder&gt;</p> 
<code>crux barista [options] &lt;list&nbsp;of&nbsp;protein&nbsp;database&nbsp;files&gt;&nbsp;&lt;list&nbsp;of&nbsp;sqt&nbsp;files&gt;&nbsp;&lt;list&nbsp;of&nbsp;ms2&nbsp;files&gt; </p> 
<code>crux barista [options] &lt;protein&nbsp;database&nbsp;file&gt;&nbsp;&lt;sqt&nbsp;file&gt;&nbsp;&lt;ms2&nbsp;file&gt; 

</code>
</blockquote>


<p>
<b>Required Input:</b></p>

<ul>

<li>
protein database &ndash; The program requires the protein database
files against which the search was performed. The protein database
input may be a concatenated database or separate target and decoy
databases. However, in both cases, the program distinguishes between
target and decoy proteins based on the decoy prefix. There is an
option to specify the prefix to the protein name that indicates a
decoy, the default is "random_".
   
</p>
The format of the input can be a directory containing the database
files, a text file with a list of protein database files or a single
database file.  If the protein database input contains suffix "fasta",
the program assumes a single-file input. Otherwise it checks whether
the input is a directory or a text file.
</li>
</p>
<li>
psm input &ndash; Barista recognizes sqt format for psm input. The psm
input can be specified as a single file with suffix "sqt" and should
be accompanied by the corresponding ms2 file as a third required
argument. Alternatively, psm input can be given as a text file containing
the list of all the "sqt" files and should be accompanied by the text
file with the list of the corresponding ms2 files as a third required
argument. 
</p>
Finally, the psm input can be specified as a directory in which all
the database search results are located. In this case, the program
collects all the files with prefix "sqt" contained in the directory and
analyses them jointly. As it finds each sqt file, it simultaneously
searches the ms2 input directory for an ms2 file with the same name,
but with the suffix "sqt" replaced with suffix the "ms2".

</p>
The multiple files can be results of many different experiments or of
multiple duplicate runs. They can also be the result of separate
target and decoy searches.  All such files in the given directory are
analyzed jointly.
</p>
<li>
ms2 input &ndash; The ms2 input can be specified as a single file with
suffix "ms2" and as a text file containing the list of all the ms2
files and or as a directory where all the ms2 files corresponding to
the psm input in the second argument can be found.

</ul>

<B>Output:</B>

<UL>
<p>
The program writes files to the folder <code>crux-output</code> by
default.  The name of the output folder can be set by the user using
the <code>--output-dir</code> option.  The following files will be
created:</p>

<li>
<b>barista.target.html</b>: an HTML file that summarizes the protein
ranking in a human-readable format.  Sets of indistinguishable
proteins are grouped together, and their IDs are printed along with
the Barista q-value.  Along with each protein group is a list of the
corresponding peptides. The information about each peptide includes its
amino acid sequence, scan and charge of the peptide, its position in
the protein, the q-value and score assigned by Barista. Following is a
portion of a sample output file, showing the identification of a pair
of proteins:</li>

<hr></hr>

<p>
<table cellpadding="10">

<tr><td><b>q-value</b></td><td><b>score</b></td><td><b>ID</b></td>
<td><b>Peptides</b></td><td><b>Matched</b></td>
<td><b>Description</b></td></tr>

<tr><td>0.001</td><td>1.25</td><td>foo</td><td>12</td><td>3</td>
<td>Phosphotyrosine glutamate transporter</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td></td><td>foobar</td><td>7</td><td>3</td>
<td>Phosphotyrosine glutamate transporter (N-terminal domain)</td></tr>
</table>

<ul>
<table cellpadding="5" border="1">
<tr><td>EAMPK</td><td>scan=000230</td><td>charge=2</td><td>20-24</td><td>q=0.07</td><td>score=1.27</td></tr>
<tr><td>YRMLK</td><td>scan=004870</td><td>charge=2</td><td>27-31</td><td>q=0.09</td><td>score=1.05</td></tr>
<tr><td>NLMMRPPK</td><td>scan=006790</td><td>charge=3</td><td>54-61</td><td>q=0.59</td><td>score=-0.09</td></tr>
</table>
</ul>

<hr></hr>

<li>
<b>barista.target.proteins.txt</b>: a tab-delimited file containing a
ranked list of groups of indistinguishable target proteins with
associated Barista scores and q-values and with peptides that
contributed to the identification of the protein group).  The
following columns are included: proteins in group, Barista score,
decoy q-value, peptides with scan and charge (for example,
EAMPK-001285.2).  The semantics of these columns are explained
in <a href="txt-format.html">this document</a>.</li>

<li>
<b>barista.target.peptides.txt</b>: a tab-delimited file containing a
ranked list of target peptides with the associated Barista scores and
q-values.  The following columns are included: peptide, scan of
spectrum in the peptide-spectrum match, charge of spectrum in the
peptide-spectrum match, Barista score, decoy q-value.  The semantics
of these columns are explained in <a href="txt-format.html">this
document</a>.</li>

<li>
<b>barista.target.psm.txt</b>: a tab-delimited file containing a
ranked list of target peptide-spectrum matches with the associated
Barista scores and q-values.  The following columns are included: scan
of spectrum in the peptide-spectrum match, charge of spectrum in the
peptide-spectrum match, peptide in the peptide-spectrum match, Barista
score, decoy q-value, the filename where each psm was found.  The
semantics of these columns are explained
in <a href="txt-format.html">this document</a>.</li>

</ul>

<b>Options:</b>

<ul>

<li>
<code>--enzyme trypsin|chymotrypsin|elastase</code> &ndash; The enzyme
used to digest the proteins in the experiment.  Default =
trypsin.</li>

<li>
<code>--decoy-prefix &lt;string&gt;</code> &ndash; specifies the
prefix of the protein names that indicates a decoy.
</li>

<li>
<code>--fileroot &lt;string&gt;</code> &ndash; 
The <code>fileroot</code> string will be added as a prefix to all
output file names. Default = none.
</li>


<li>
<code>--output-dir &lt;filename&gt;</code> &ndash; 
The name of the directory where output files will be created.
Default = crux-output.
</li>

<li>
<code>--skip-cleanup &lt;T/F&gt;</code> &ndash; Barista analysis
consists of preprocessing data and creating lookup tables which are
then used during training. This option allows keeping the tables after
the analysis and doing training directly by specifying the
--dir-with-tables option (see below). Default = F.
</li>


<li>
<code>--dir-with-tables &lt;filename&gt;</code> &ndash; The name of
the directory where the lookup tables with preprocessed data are
