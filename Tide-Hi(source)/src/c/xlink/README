To compile, change the crux_source and crux_lib variables
in Makefile to point to crux source file and the libcrux.a
library (after crux has been compiled).

Then run make to compile.

Make a directory called crux-ouput for output files



Four executables are created:

  xhhc-predict-peptide-ions
  xhhc-score-peptide-spectrum
  xhhc-make-histogram
  xhhc-search

Usage is at the bottom of readme.

There are 7 source files:

  xhhc.cpp
  xhhc_ion_series.cpp
  xhhc_scorer.cpp

  xhhc_predict_peptide_ions.cpp
  xhhc_score_peptide_spectrum.cpp
  xhhc_make_histogram.cpp
  xhhc_search.cpp 




Things to do:

- fix xhhc-make-histogram
- fix print_spectrums method in xhhc_scorer
- fix memory leak in xhhc-search
- fix get_linkable_peptides method in xhhc.cpp to work for all linkers
    - implement missed-link-cleavage and num-missed-cleavages options

  




Usage: xhhc-score-peptide-spectrum [options] <peptide-sequence-alpha> <peptide-sequence-beta> <position A> <position B> <scan-number> <ms2-filename> 
Optional Arguments:
  [--charge <int>] The peptide charge. 1|2|3 
  [--parameter-file <string>] The crux parameter file to parse parameter from. 
  [--linker-mass <string>] linker mass and linker modifications. Default 0. 
  [--print-spectrums <int>]  
  [--verbosity <int>] Specify the verbosity of the current processes from 0-100. 
Required Arguments:
  <peptide-sequence-alpha> The first peptide sequence.
  <peptide-sequence-beta> The second peptide sequence.
  <position A> zero based index of linker on peptide A [0, length(A)-1]
  <position B> zero based index of linker on peptide B [0, length(B)-1]
  <scan-number> The scan number for the MS-MS spectrum to extract from the ms2 file.
	This is an integer in the range [1, 100000], and uniquely identifies a particular MS-MS spectrum within an .ms2 file.
  <ms2-filename> A file containing multiple MS-MS spectra in .ms2 format.
