Full directions for installing Crux can be found in doc/users/install-tutorial.html.

Building Crux from source requires a C++ compiler and standard libraries. It
also requires the programs 'cmake' and 'svn'. To build Crux from a source 
distribution or a copy checked out from the SVN repository:

1. Run 'cmake .'. This generates all the final 'Makefile' from the 'CMakeLists.txt'.
   See text below for a description of some useful 'cmake' options.
2. Run 'make'. This will build Crux. Crux depends on the Proteowizard libraries
   (http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net). These will automatically be obtained
   from the Proteowizard SVN repository.
3. Run 'make install'.

The 'cmake' program accepts several command line options. These are described
in the CMake documentation, available at http://www.cmake.org.  Three of the
most useful options are described below.

By default CMake will install Crux in /usr/local. To specify a different
installation directory use:

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=<install directory> .

where you should replace '<install directory>' with the full path to the
root directory where Crux should be installed.

By default CMake will perform a non-debug build of Crux. To turn on debugging
symbols use:

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .

By default CMake will hide most of the processing messages from the compiler
and linker.  To turn on 'verbose' messages use:

cmake -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON .
